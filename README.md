# Example of use: 
Search for files that contain malicious code chunks after a JS injection attack on your WordPress website

# Config

Before running the scan.php file, properly configure the variables existing at the beginning of the file.

```php


// Enter the directory to be scanned here Ex: /home/myuser/var/www/html/
$dir = "/YOUR DIRECTORY HERE/"; 

// Include the code to be searched for in this file
$code = file_get_contents("code.txt");

// Set true if you want to remove the code when found
$removeCode = false; 

// Set types of files that will be searched
$searchExtensions = ["js","php","txt"];


```
